# CinemaRoomRestService-HyperSkill-JavaBackEndProject
In this project, we will create a simple Spring REST service that will help us manage a small movie theatre. Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects.

I have used gradle here , but you can use maven too , just add dependencies accordingly
This the project from HyperSkill JavaBackend course
